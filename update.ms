# OpenAlgo SDK Integration & Observability Revamp Plan

This document provides detailed guidance for an AI agent to tightly integrate OpenAlgo via its SDK (no REST usage), migrate persistence to InfluxDB, introduce Redis caching, and expand both the Flask UI and Grafana dashboards with trader-centric insights. Follow the phases sequentially unless specified.

## Phase 0 – Discovery & Environment Preparation
1. **Audit current state**
   - Inventory all modules that depend on SQLite, REST-based brokers, or the existing paper trading implementation.
   - Map out where market/trade data is produced, consumed, cached, and visualized (Flask UI, scripts, background jobs).
2. **Set up prerequisites**
   - Validate existing virtual environment and dependency versions; update requirement files as needed.
   - Acquire OpenAlgo SDK credentials and confirm SDK availability (mock or sandbox where possible).
   - Ensure Docker Compose (if used) supports running InfluxDB, Redis, Grafana, and any OpenAlgo SDK dependencies.

## Phase 1 – OpenAlgo SDK Integration & Paper Trading Alignment
1. **SDK bootstrap**
   - Add the OpenAlgo SDK to the project dependencies (requirements.txt / setup).
   - Create a dedicated service module (e.g., `third_party/openalgo_sdk_service.py`) that encapsulates authentication, session management, and error handling without exposing raw SDK calls elsewhere.
2. **Account & instrument management**
   - Implement functions for retrieving account info, balances, and instrument metadata required by the trading strategies.
   - Provide caching hooks (to be wired to Redis later) for static metadata.
3. **Market data streaming**
   - Replace existing REST polling with SDK-based market data subscriptions or streaming where supported. Define asynchronous handlers or event loops as needed.
   - Normalize incoming data into the internal schema expected by strategies and the data pipeline.
4. **Order management & paper trading**
   - Build order placement, modification, cancellation, and status tracking functions using the SDK’s paper trading endpoints.
   - Implement resilient retry/backoff logic and detailed logging for failures.
   - Ensure trade execution events feed both the analytics pipeline and UI dashboards.
5. **Strategy integration**
   - Update strategy modules to depend on the new service layer instead of direct DB/REST calls.
   - Provide unit/integration tests that simulate SDK responses (mocking where necessary).

## Phase 2 – Replace SQLite with InfluxDB
1. **Schema design**
   - Define measurement schemas for market ticks, order events, positions, P&L, and system metrics.
   - Document tags, fields, and retention policies aligned with trading analytics needs.
2. **Data migration**
   - Export historical SQLite data into InfluxDB-compatible line protocol or use intermediary scripts.
   - Validate data integrity and time-series ordering post-migration.
3. **Data access layer refactor**
   - Replace ORM/SQL calls with InfluxDB client queries.
   - Abstract InfluxDB interactions behind repository classes to ease testing and potential future migrations.
4. **Write path updates**
   - Ensure all data producers (strategies, paper trading events, analytics jobs) write to InfluxDB.
   - Implement batch writes and retry logic to handle network hiccups.
5. **Testing**
   - Build automated tests for read/write operations, including edge cases (out-of-order timestamps, missing fields).

## Phase 3 – Introduce Redis Caching Layer
1. **Architecture decisions**
   - Determine what data warrants caching: instrument metadata, recent market snapshots, computed indicators, session tokens.
   - Define TTL strategies and cache invalidation policies.
2. **Implementation**
   - Add Redis client initialization with connection pooling.
   - Wrap caching around data-fetching services (OpenAlgo metadata, InfluxDB query results, computed analytics).
   - Create helper decorators/utilities for cache read-through/write-through patterns.
3. **Resilience**
   - Implement graceful fallbacks when Redis is unavailable (log warning, bypass cache).
   - Monitor cache hit/miss metrics for Grafana dashboards.

## Phase 4 – Observability & Dashboards
1. **Grafana dashboards**
   - Provision Grafana datasources for InfluxDB and Redis (if needed).
   - Create dashboards displaying:
     - Real-time P&L, equity curve, and drawdown.
     - Trade execution timelines and order book depth.
     - Strategy-level KPIs (win rate, Sharpe ratio, exposure).
     - System health (latency, cache hit rate, SDK errors).
   - Include annotations for major trade events or strategy switches.
2. **Alerting**
   - Configure Grafana alerts for critical thresholds (P&L drawdown, data feed stoppage, Redis outage).
   - Integrate alert notifications with existing ops channels (email, Slack, etc.).

## Phase 5 – Flask UI Enhancements (Trader-centric)
1. **UX audit**
   - Review current Flask UI components; list gaps vs trader needs.
2. **Data integration**
   - Update Flask routes and templates to pull data via the new service layer and caches.
   - Provide endpoints for:
     - Live positions and order status with latency indicators.
     - Strategy performance summaries, risk metrics, and trade rationale.
     - Scenario analysis widgets (e.g., what-if P&L under volatility shifts) backed by analytics scripts.
3. **Visual enhancements**
   - Integrate interactive charts (e.g., Plotly or Chart.js) for P&L, volume, and price overlays.
   - Add tables for trade logs with filtering and tagging for trade quality reviews.
4. **Robustness**
   - Implement global error handling, loading states, and user notifications for data latency or API issues.
   - Ensure the UI reflects cache status and last data refresh times.

## Phase 6 – Reliability & Operations Hardening
1. **Configuration management**
   - Centralize environment variables and credentials (OpenAlgo keys, Redis/Influx endpoints) with secure storage.
   - Provide configuration validation on startup.
2. **Background jobs & scheduling**
   - Ensure periodic tasks (rebalancing, data exports) run via a scheduler (Celery/Redis Queue/cron) using the new infrastructure.
3. **Resilience testing**
   - Simulate component failures (SDK downtime, Redis eviction, InfluxDB delay) and verify graceful degradation.
   - Document incident response playbooks.
4. **CI/CD updates**
   - Extend automated tests to cover new modules.
   - Include linting, type checking, and integration tests with mocked services in the pipeline.

## Phase 7 – Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
1. **Update project documentation**
   - Refresh README and setup guides to reflect new dependencies and workflows.
   - Provide runbooks for starting/stopping services (Docker Compose or scripts) and troubleshooting common issues.
2. **Knowledge base**
   - Create detailed module-level docs explaining data flows, caching strategy, and dashboard configurations.
   - Record known limitations and future enhancement ideas.

## Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] OpenAlgo SDK service layer integrated with strategies and paper trading.
- [ ] SQLite fully replaced by InfluxDB with tested data pipelines.
- [ ] Redis caching implemented with resilience safeguards.
- [ ] Grafana dashboards providing real-time and historical trader insights plus alerting.
- [ ] Flask UI upgraded with analytics, charts, and trader-focused metrics.
- [ ] Automated tests and operational documentation updated.

Follow each phase sequentially, delivering verifiable checkpoints before moving on. Ensure cross-functional validation (developers, traders, operations) after each major milestone.
